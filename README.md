Welcome anyone who wants to contribute to the EmbedGame Plugin.

There is two branches
- main-with-gdextension
  - This branch only has windows support and godo 4.3. support
- main-gdscript-only
  - This branch works on all OS'es and Godot 4.x versions, but doesn't have reliable behavior yet.

You can find the itch page and most information [here]([url](https://fabimakesgames.itch.io/embedgame)) for now.

If you want to add support for a different OS. Basically, the window management functions must be reimplemented using each OS'es native API. I for now only did it for windows.
Sorry for the very short text here, I am quite busy these days, but if you have specific questions just reach out to me on discord you can find my most recent link [here](linktr.ee/fabimakesgames)
best,
